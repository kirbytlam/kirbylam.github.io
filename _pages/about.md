Hello! I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience at Duke University. 

As a social psychologist and neuroscientist in-training, I am currently co-advised by Dr. Cristina Salvador ([Duke Culture Lab](https://sites.duke.edu/culturelab/)) and Dr. Sarah Gaither ([Identity & Diversity Lab](https://sites.duke.edu/dukeidlab/)) in their respective labs. My work investigates the sociocognitive and neurophysiological mechanisms underlying racial inequities. I am interested in how our identities (e.g., race, culture, gender) shape our constructions and violations of social norms.

Prior to Duke, I graduated from Pomona College (2023) with a B.A. in Psychological Science with Distinction and a minor in Asian American Studies.
